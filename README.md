# Binance-COPY 


### Mostly presentational copy of the Binance landing page

This project was a challlenge for me that i gave myself to test if i can replicate the front-end page from a big company. The project has all the front-end features the real landing page has. The feartures are:

* All presentational components having the same behavior

* Dark mode

* Hover effects

* Using an API to load cryptocurrency values(The API is free so it reaches the call limit 
really fast sadly)

* Responsive design for mobile phones, tablets, laptops and monitors.

All the features this project lacks are features that require server data such as all the translations for all the languages the site lists, loggin in, downloading the app, loading another web page through a link click(this one can be done, but pages that the landing page goes to have either forms or require you to log in).

All these features that are lacking can easily be implemented in the codebase of this project, because it was made with that in mind.

## Technology decisions:
* For starting the react app - Vite
* For styling - Tailwind
* Error catching - eslint
* For icons - react-icons
* For routes(only one is used) - react-router-dom
* For UI state managment - Context API
